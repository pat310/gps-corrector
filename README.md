# GPS Corrector
[GPS Corrector](https://www.gpscorrector.com) is a tool for correcting GPS data. Often times when running in an area with satellite interference (such as a city with tall buildings) the GPS device will log incorrect data points which will cause the route and pacing to be incorrect.

## How do I use it?
1. Upload the gps data file you need to correct
2. Click the line button to draw a box around the points you need to fix - it's recommended that you do this on no more than a few hundred points at a time
3. Repeat step 2 as necessary to correct any anomalous points
4. Click download to get corrected data file.
